    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I am persuing my degree in btech in <a href="https://cse.ap.gov.in/">computer science branch</a> at <a href="https://pmec.ac.in/">Parala Maharaja Engineering College</a>. I secured 88% in my 10th board. I scored 80% in my 12th board examination. Then I dropped 1 year for the preparation of medical examination i.e. <a href="https://www.ntaneet.nic.in/">NEET</a>. But I didnot score well in that examination because of lack of my interest. But thanks to God that I have also appeareed in <a href="https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/">JEE</a> examination. I also not scored good marks in that exam. But I was able to get into a government institute of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha">Odisha</a>.Then the biggest problem arises when you dont know what to do. Like always I got confused to choose my carrier that to choose which branch. Then due to a lot of advices I choosed <a href="https://cse.ap.gov.in/">CSE branch</a> anyhow.Now I am very much happy to be an CSEian. Initially I suffered a lot as I didn't know any programming language but after struggling for 6 months I got comfortable at the stage where I am. I started falling in ‚ù§ with coding. Now I have learnt C , basic JAVA language. Currently I am persuing my web development course at udemy. I have learnt somewhat of HTML. And I am happy and satisfied with my decision which I have taken before a year. Hope I will achieve all the goals which I have dreamt.</p>
